# K-Means Cluster Analysis
Implementing different clustering methods to synthetic and real-world data and validating it using external and internal validation techniques
such as K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to generate clusters with visualization

## Part 1
- Using K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to generate clusters
- Evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm using external validation metrics
- Plotting the results and comparing them before and after clustering

## Part 2
- Using K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to group similar countries together
- Using Internal validation metrics to report the cluster quality
- Reporting the best clustering solution by giving a detailed list of all the groups and the countries included within the groups
- Scatter plotting the results
